### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    This is one of my favorite labs because it taught us how to use if else
    statements, which was done in part 2. These statements were used for a
    game called Hilo, where a player guesses a number and the computer
    has to respond appropriately. In part 1, I learned of using multiple
    files to compile, which was very cool and new to me, the main file 
    had the functions being called and the second file had the definitions
    of these functions. These functions were made toprocess ML to other
    units, very cool.

* Lab 6

    This is another favorite lab of mine as it introduced vectors, which 
    was a new and exciting concept for me to learn. Vectors being a part 
    of the future labs make this lab special to me. In part 1, the user has
    to input three valid descriptions for the sandwich, which the computer
    takes into a vector and outputs it into the screen. In part 2 we 
    constructed a blackjack game which was done with multiple functions
    using separate files, this was very fun to do like lab 4. 

* Lab 9

    This lab is another favorite of mine because I did it all on my own 
    because I could not make it class that day. Part 1 was about getting 
    the average of a group of numbers but removing the biggest and smallest
    number beforehand, this was done with one function. The second part is
    about making sure two people dont have conflicting schedules, this is
    done with a for loop comparing these schedules and if elsestatements.
    I see this lab as one of my favorites because it shows that I can do it
    with no help.
